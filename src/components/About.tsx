                        ðŸ“Œ I started my Front End Engineer journey {timeSince}{' '}
                        years ago learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I
                        have completed a handful of online certificates from
                        Codecademy and TreeHouse that have expanded my knowledge
                        using programs such as Figma, Storybook, and Insomnia. I
                        am obsessed with Chrome DevTools.

                    <br />
                    <p>
                        ðŸ“Œ Additionally, prior to starting my tech adventure, I
                        worked in retail store management for about 10 years. My
                        goal was to provide the best experience possible to each
                        and every customer. I strived to exceed expectations and
                        improve the customer experience while continuing to lead
                        a team and complete projects with proficient time
                        management.

                    <p>
                        ðŸ“Œ My passion is providing excellent customer service
                        and helping clients excel in their fields. I am a quick
                        learner with a fun, outgoing personality. In addition, I
                        transcend in the ability to work under pressure and
                        handle stressful situations very well.
